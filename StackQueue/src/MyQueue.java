//MyQueue
//
//Has attributes front and numInQueue.  
//The queue is initialized (via the constructor) to being empty.
//
//Has methods enqueue, dequeue, displayQueue.  
//enqueue and displayQueue are to be void methods.  
//dequeue returns reference to the item dequeued, and return null if the queue is empty.  
//displayQueue is to work like displayStack, but prints out the students from the front to the rear.
