//MyStack
//
//Has attributes top and numInStack.  
//The stack is initialized (via the constructor) to being empty.
//
//Has methods push, pop, peek, displayStack.  
//push and displayStack are to be void methods.  
//pop and peek return reference to the item popped/peeked, 
//and return null if the stack is empty.  
//displayStack is to use System.out.println to walk through 
//and print the students in the stack from top to bottom 
//(and is to say that the stack is empty if it is indeed empty).
